            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas by two former Proclamations, the one dated the twentieth</hi> of Nouember, and the other the two and twentieth of December laſt Wee did publiſh and declare Our Royall pleaſure concerning the repaire of the Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and of other perſons fo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from the Cities of London and weſtminſter, and other parts adia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and from other Cities and Townes vnto their Countrey dwellings: wee haue lately cauſed diligent ſuruey and enquiry to made in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of London and weſtininſter and the Suburbs of the ſame; whereby it appeared, That as many perſons of qualitie and worth, both men and women, haue duetifully ſubmitted to Our gracious commandement, ſo diuers haue not onely neglected the ſame, but retiring for a time vnto ſome in or neare the ſaid Cities, where they ſecretly ſoiourne, or otherwiſe obſcure and couer themſelues onely to be out of the way of enquiry, doe endeauour ſo clude and fruſtrate Our ſincere and Honourable intendments, whereat We aimed in both Our ſaid Proclamations, which is the reuiuing and ſetling of Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and good Gouernment in all the parts of this Our Kingdome. And therefore, as Wee may not let paſſe the obedience of the one, without Our Gracious approbation and acceptance; ſo Wee cannot but giue notice to the other, that We are ſensible of their contempt, and that thoſe ſubtilties and euaſions, can neither hide them from the eye of Our prouidence, nor excuſe them from the hand of Our Juſtice, which without Our greater clemency, expecting their ſpeedy reformation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie, would ſoone ſeize and lay hold on them for their obſtinacie and diſobedience; And therefore We being fully reſolued for the generall good of Our people to perfect that worke which Wee haue (vpon ſuch iuſt grounds and important reaſons) begunned, Haue thought fit once more to admoniſh all ſuch as haue not yet conformed to Our ſaid Proclamations, That they immediatly yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereto by repairing with their families to their proper dwellings &amp; habitations in the Country, as by Our former Proclamations they were enioyned, and that ſuch as are at this preſent reſident in their Countreys doe there continue their habitations and families; And that all perſons doe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare by ſoiourning in or about any Cities or Townes, or by any other euaſions whatſoeuer, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the fruſtrating of the ſaid Proclamations. And to the intent, that none ſhould vpon hope of alteration of Our purpoſe either take or keepe houſes in or about the Cities of London or Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with intent to withdraw themſelues, their wiues or families thither from their habitations in the Countrey in the winter next enſuing, We haue thought good to let them know, That Wee are fully determined to hold the ſame courſe then, which We haue formerly propounded, and therefore they being forewarned may ſo diſpoſe of their affaires, as with leaſt intonuenience to themſelues they may performe Our Royall commandement, giuen by this and other Our former Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
